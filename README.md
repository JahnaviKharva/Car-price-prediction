# Car-price-prediction
In this project i have predicted the selling price of a car. I have used two techniques in this project : 1. Linear Regression and 2. Lasso Regression.
In this, R squared error value is less for linear regression. 
So that i have analysed that Linear Regression performs better compare to Lasso Regression.
